== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does GreenMetrics calculate my site's environmental impact? =
We use a combination of observed data based on asset size, page views, and HTTP requests. Our calculations account for data transfer, energy consumption per byte, and regional carbon intensity to provide meaningful insights.

= Will it slow down my website? =
No. GreenMetrics is lightweight and designed for performance. It uses efficient tracking methods and does not load external scripts on the frontend.

= Can I customize how the metrics are displayed? =
Yes, the shortcode and block offer multiple customization options including position (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right), theme (light/dark), and size (small/medium/large).

= How accurate are the carbon and energy calculations? =
Our calculations are based on industry research regarding energy consumption per byte of data transferred and carbon intensity of electrical grids. While they provide meaningful approximations, they may not account for all variables in the hosting infrastructure.

= Can I track individual page performance? =
Yes, GreenMetrics tracks metrics on a per-page basis, allowing you to identify which pages have the highest environmental impact and optimize them accordingly.

= Does the plugin work with caching plugins? =
Yes, GreenMetrics is compatible with most popular caching plugins. It tracks actual user visits regardless of whether they're served cached content.
